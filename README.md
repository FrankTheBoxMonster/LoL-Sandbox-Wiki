# LoL-Sandbox-Wiki

A collection of various details and specifications for the internal workings of League of Legends and LoL Sandbox projects.  This mainly exists to provide some redundancies against [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

If a specific topic appears to be lacking in detail, clarity, accuracy, or existence, make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/FrankTheBoxMonster/LoL-Sandbox-Wiki/issues) about it if one does not exist already, describing what you would like to see.  If a similar issue already exists, comment on the issue if you see something being left out.

Topics that are on the table, pretty much anything related to:

 * sandbox projects
 * the more technical sides of League
 * sandbox lore storytimes
 * bug histories and theories/explanations
 * special interactions or implementation details of certain spells or mechanics
 * evolutions of mechanics over time
 * any interesting details or quirks that have been picked up over the years
